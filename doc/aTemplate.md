Hi Bonnie, hope all is well.

First off, I can not apologize enough for how long it took me to complete the website. I hope I can make up for it.

+ I will contract a web-designer to refine the UI (I'm not happy with it)
+ and, of course I continue towards version 2... with the OneDrive integration

The site is ready to go ...though I just identified a few, very minor, UI feedback to do: error checking user input, "missing required field" type stuff. While I wrap those up there are a few things you should be doing:

+ A transparent background versions of:
  - https://lifestylesja.com/media/iw_logo_lightbg.png
  - https://lifestylesja.com/media/iw_white_bulb.png

+ Create an account at Stripe.com
  - Goto: [Start Now] > then Create account
  - Keep the account in test mode, for now.

  - add me as administrator & developer at: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team

+ Add products (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products)
  - Example:
  - Note the need to specify the manufacturer: 3M, Avery, ...
  - Note also, products added here automatically appear on the site


+ I'll need access to the DNS for imaginewrapsca.com domain
  - a list of the email addresses you want
